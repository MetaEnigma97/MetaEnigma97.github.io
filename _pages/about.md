# About Me

🏫 I am a final year PhD student supervised by [Prof. Koji Tsuda(津田 宏治)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HvVqBmkAAAAJ&hl=en) in [Laboratory of Large-Scale Knowledge Discovery (Tsuda Lab)](https://www.tsudalab.org/) in Department of Computational Biology & Medical Science at The Unversity of Tokyo. I was a visiting scholar in [Assoc. Prof. Olexandr Isayev](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ICaR4EAAAAJ&hl=en)'s lab in Department of Chemistry in Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2023. I obtained my MEng. from Department of Mechanical Engineering at The University of Tokyo in September 2021, supervised by [Prof. Yuji Suzuki(鈴木 雄二)](http://www.mesl.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/users/ysuzuki/). Before that, I got my BEng. from Department of Mechanical Engineering at Shandong University in June 2019.
