Education
======
* Doctor of Science, Department of Computational Biology & Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Oct.2021-Sep.2024 (expected)
* Visiting Scholar, Department of Chemistry, Carnegie Mellon University, Sep.2023-Nov.2023
* Master of Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Sep.2019-Sep.2021
* Bachelor of Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Shandong University, Sep.2015-Jun.2019

Work experience
======
* [Preferred Networks](https://www.preferred.jp/en/): Part-time Employee, Dec.2023-
  * Complete the research on designing equivariant nerual networks for materials propery prediction.
  * The study will be an example for customers about usage of Matlantis on material discovery application.

* [Preferred Networks](https://www.preferred.jp/en/): Research Internship, Aug.2023-Sep.2023
  * R&D on material discovery algorithms using Neural Network Potential (NNP) in [Matlantis](https://matlantis.com/) Group.
  * Design equivariant neural networks for material property prediction. Initial results showed our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art models. More validation is going to be conducted to prepare an academic paper.

* [RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP)](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/): Student Trainee, Oct.2021-
  * Design liquid electret materials for stretchable energy harvesters based on machine learning.
  * Validate the designed promising candidate materials with quantum chemistry computation and experiments.
