# Abstract

Both positive and negative charging performances of amorphous polymer electret with different end groups are evaluated by density functional theory and the polarizable continuum model. The computed electron affinity and ionization potential values can be the measure of the charge trapping depth, and are in qualitative agreement with the experiment data after charging. The batch computation method is also provided for screening candidates with specific end groups toward higher bipolar charging performance.
