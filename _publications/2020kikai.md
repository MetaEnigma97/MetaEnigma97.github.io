# Abstract

The charge trapping depth of negatively-charged CYTOP polymer electret is evaluated by density function theory, with polarizable continuum model incorporated. The computed electron affinity values are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with experiment, while giving similar results with solid-state analysis based on previous MD/DFT approach.
